          <p>The main advantage is cooking time in microwave oven reduces to one fourth of the time taken on gas stoves. So, the energy and time are saved.
          The utensils in the oven do not get heated, only the food gets heated.
          Heating frozen foods through microwave oven takes less time.
          It cooks food uniformly and the flavor and the texture of the food are not changed when reheated.
