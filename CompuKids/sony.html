          <p>Battery Life - Just like the first couple of iterations of Sony mirrorless cameras, the Fuji X-T series has mediocre battery life at best, especially when compared to DSLRs or the latest Sony full-frame cameras.
           Autofocus - While Dawood calls AF on the X-T3 "fantastic" for stills shooting, he says the video autofocus is just "not that great." Part of the problem is that it looks "too digital"- a snappy focus that's great for stills but provides no smooth transition for video shooters.
           Lenses - Fuji has a great selection of X-series lenses, but Dawood maintains that some "core" lenses are either missing or need to be updated.
           Bonus: Crop Mode - On Sony cameras, you can crop in to APS-C mode and get two focal lengths for the price of one, without sacrificing video resolution. Obviously something a crop-sensor camera can't do, though Fuji could implement its own digital crop.</p>
